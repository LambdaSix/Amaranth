This document discusses the low-level combat mechanics.

High-level goals:
- The mechanics should be as simple as possible so they can be comprehensible.
  With permadeath, it's important for players to be able to predict the
  consequences of their actions.
- Monsters should be diverse enough in attributes and behavior to make the
  player feel like their are interacting with a rich and varied world. It
  shouldn't just be a grind of "now I can kill slightly stronger things."
- It should be possible to improve the hero in enough different dimensions that
  the game is replayable. Each hero should be unique, and end-game heroes should
  not all be identical.
- There should be chance involved so that the game can surprise the player.
- Combat should be heroic. A hero near-death should still be able to deal heroic
  damage.

Overall feel:
- I want the micro-level gameplay experience (i.e. battling monsters) to feel
  like a puzzle or board game with a little bit of chance thrown in.
- Given a screenshot of the game, an experienced player should be able to come
  up with a pretty well-defined strategy to defeat the nearby monsters.
- Different monsters should lead to very different strategies.
- Every now and then, something catastrophic or awesome should happen to keep
  the player on their toes. Emotional impact requires big moments.
- Combat should feel mostly like a chessgame: puzzle-like.
- Pokemon combat is a good example: for any given fight a skilled player adopts
  a different set of Pokemon to use and specific attack sequences.
- Boss fights in Angband are another good example (lots of teleporting around,
  using specific items, etc.). But regular Angband combat (grind grind grind)
  is not a good example.

Changes to existing mechanics:
- Get rid of some if possible.
- Make fewer things use random ranges.  

Mechanics:

Health: ranges from a race-specific max to zero. When it hits zero, the entity
dies.

Agility: how quick and nimble an entity is. Determines how likely it is to hit
another, and how hard it is to hit.

Damage: how much damage an entity does when it hits. For monsters, this is based
on the attack used. For heroes, it comes from the weapon.
